    "# Estimating COVID-19's $R_t$\n",
    "\n",
    "The $R_t$, or effective reproduction number, is the number of people who become infected per infectious person at time $t$. The most well-known version of this number is the basic reproduction number: $R_0$ when $t=0$. While $R_0$ reflects the infectivility at the begining of an epidemic, before any control measures have been enacted, the $R_t$ will change over time as these measures take effect. In general, an $R_t$ below 1 means that the situation is under control.\n",
